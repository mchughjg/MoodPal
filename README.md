Hello! Welcome to my project, MoodPal.

Overview

MoodPal is a mobile application designed to help users track their daily moods and reflect on their emotional well-being over time. 
By providing a user-friendly interface for entering and reviewing mood data, MoodPal aims to encourage mindfulness and greater emotional awareness.

Features

Mood Logging: Users can log their mood at any time of day with a few simple taps. Each entry allows the user to select their current mood from a set of mood icons and add optional notes for context.
Mood History: Users can view a history of their mood entries, displayed both as a timeline and a statistical overview, helping them identify patterns in their emotional state over time.
Mood Analysis: The app provides basic analytics, such as mood trends and the most frequent moods, to offer insights into the userâ€™s emotional cycles.

How It Works

MoodPal utilizes a simple yet effective interface to facilitate easy navigation and interaction:

Dashboard: Upon opening the app, the user is greeted by the Dashboard, which displays options to log a new mood or view their mood history.
Mood Entry: When logging a mood, the user selects from visually representative mood icons. Each selection can be accompanied by a textual note for additional details.
History and Analytics: The Mood History section visualizes past entries, allowing users to scroll through their mood data or view graphical representations of mood trends.

Code and Screenshots

Thanks for evaluating my mobile application! :)
